As a part of lab assignment, Running and building and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Understanding and running  prominent aspects of applied deep learning: facial detection and algorithmic bias.

The practice lab sessions and tutorial helped gain insights on  building  a facial detection model that learns the face image datasets and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present in order to train a debiased model.
